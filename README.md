# CoC-L
Code of Conduct - a data-driven approach


more than 160 existing codes in English were collected. The codes we collected belonged to different types of organisations (such as academia, science associations, industries, etc) from all around the world. 


I did a standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on the corpus to extract topics, possible relations between codes, and any other insights that were out of reach by just reading those documents â€“ if even anyone had the patience to read couple of thousands of pages.  I presented the outcome in two preparatory workshops in The Hague Ethical Guidelines.

I used a commercial package developed by  Provalis  Research. I had to deal with some challenges with inflexibility that many commercial packages have. Luckily, this is not the case anymore since I started using R for text mining. During the winter break, I imported those documents and created a Shiny App to make world clouds.  Play around with ranges and variables.
